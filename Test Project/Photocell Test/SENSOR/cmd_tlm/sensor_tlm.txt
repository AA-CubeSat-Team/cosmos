# A byte stores an 8-bit unsigned number, from 0 to 255.

# On the Arduino Uno (and other ATmega based boards) an int stores a 16-bit (2-byte) value
# This yields a range of -32,768 to 32,767 
# (minimum value of -2^15 and a maximum value of (2^15)-1).

# On the Uno and other ATMEGA based boards, unsigned ints (unsigned integers) are the same as 
# ints in that they store a 2 byte value. Instead of storing negative numbers however they only 
# store positive values, yielding a useful range of 0 to 65,535 ((2^16)-1).
